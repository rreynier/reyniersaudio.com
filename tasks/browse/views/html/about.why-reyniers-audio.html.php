                <h1>Our computers are optimized for audio</h1>
                <p>We use only top quality hardware for both performance and reliability. We only offer parts that, through benchmarking,
                    have shown to work well together. This takes the guesswork out of putting together a truly audio-worthy computer.</p>
                <p>We test different brands, chipset and technologies in our own recording studio where things like latency, glitches and
                    pops are easily gauged. <a href="/support/compatibility">Compatibility</a></p>
                <p>We minimize Windows' footprint on your CPU and RAM. Basically we take the 'stock' install of Windows and disable
                    everything not vital to audio production. <a href="/support/tweaked-for-audio">Tweaked for audio</a></p>

                <h1>Our computers are whisper quiet</h1>
                <ul class="normal-list">
                    <li>We use reliable and quiet power supplies that can handle system expansion.</li>
                    <li>We upgrade all stock heatsinks and case fans for quieter, more efficient operation.</li>
                    <li>Only enclosures engineered for silence are offered on our configuration pages.</li>
                    <li>We install soundly placed Reyniers Certified noise dampening materials.</li>
                    <li>We maximize system airflow by carefully routing and bundling internal cables. Attention to detail is key.</li>                    
                </ul>
                <p>In short, we promise you will hear the music not the machine.</p>

                <h1>Our computers are specifically tailored to your needs</h1>
                <p>Use our informative and easy to use custom configuration pages to upgrade or downgrade your computer to fit your budget
                    and requirements. Make sure to use the "Help me Decide" and "Decision Factors" tabs under each component.</p>
                <p>We will install your audio interface and software to ensure a fully turnkey solution. (a maximum of up to 5 software 
                    titles and 1 interface per computer at no extra charge).
                    <a class="ask" href="/support/support-warranty">Ask Reyniers Audio</a></p>
                <p>Our computers are fully compatible with all major audio software and hardware products on the market. Let us know what
                    software or hardware you'll be using and we'll likely have some extra tweaks suitable to your scenario.

                <h1>Our Expertise</h1>
                <p>We own and operate our own professional studio enabling us to truly understand the demands of a real-life recording session. 
                    So, instead of just building you an up-to-date computer we will actually go the extra mile to put together a solution that
                    will work properly out of the box.</p>
                <p>You have questions, we have answers. You know how many tracks you want to record simultaneously, you know how many plugins
                    you'd like to run, we know how to get you there. Call us today for a free studio consultation.</p>
                <p>Each computer that leaves our workbench goes through rigorous stress testing ensuring there are absolutely no questions about 
                    your computer's stability.</p>

                <h1>Our Support</h1>
                <p>Of course there may be a time when a call to our support staff is necessary. Chances are you'll be able to speak to the same
                    person who actually built your computer - imagine that. </p>
                <p>One Year Limited Warranty and Support is included with every purchase - Free! You also have the option to extend the
                    Limited Warranty to 2 or 3 years. <a href="/support/support-warranty">Warranty Information</a></p>
                <p>Remote support software allows our technicians to take over your system to quickly diagnose and fix software issues
                    (internet connection required). <a href="/support/remote-support">Remote support</a></p>
                <p>Once we've completed the burn-in procedure, tweaked the system and the computer is ready to be shipped, we create a 
                    System Recovery Package. This includes a full version of Acronis TrueImage Home Edition, which will allow you to create
                    your own restore points after all your software is installed.</p>
