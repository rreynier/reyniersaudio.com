                <h2> Steve Carr </h2>
                <p>
			A wonderful purchasing experience. Wouter was exceptional in taking the time to help me build exactly the right system I needed. The product performed exactly as described. I just plugged it in and turned it on. I was making music in less than an hour.</p><p>
			I would definitely recommend Reyniers Audio to anyone who is looking for professional service and a satisfying experience. I am a non-professional musician who has been making noise for about 20 years. I couldn't be happier with my new system.

                <p>
			I have been involved in the music industry in the Detroit area since 1972 (live performances as well as studio sessions) and have passed the torch on to my son. I had been wanting to upgrade my DAW for some time. I read many articles on the subject, and visited many manufacturer websites, so that when it came time to make a purchase I would be making an informed decision. Believe me when I say, before I decide to make a purchase, I do as much research as possible. I work very hard for my money and expect not only quality in the product but also in the person/company I am dealing with. I compared the products of numerous manufacturers and discovered a large variation in price for the same product (Apples to Apples comparison).</p><p>
                    Besides using DAWs, I have built them in the past and know the process involved in purchasing components, building, programming, and testing. When I came across Reyniers Audio I was very impressed by the affordability and almost infinite variations. A true custom built computer. I particularly liked the fact that you didn't have to go to another site to research the variety of components, links are provided.</p><p>
			One of the factors that led to my purchase from Reyniers Audio was the negligible cost difference between me building one and them building it. It was well worth it to have the DAW arrive and be ready to go out of the box. But the determining factor was Wouter himself. I had questions, and he had answers. We spoke at length about what I was looking for and what I expected. He helped me tremendously in making the final decision, and it was a great decision! The DAW is superb, I got my money's worth and more. I purchased a Core 2 Quad System that runs like a Motor City muscle car. It screams when it needs to and cruises when you want it to. 
                </p><p>
			I highly recommend Reyniers Audio. As far as I'm concerned, Wouter is the man! He knows his business, provides a quality product and most of all talks to his customers! I wasn't disappointed, and you won't be either. I am 100% satisfied!

                <h2>Daniel Depolito</h2>
                <p>I am a hobbyist songwriter who was searching to upgrade my original DAW that was purchased back in 2002.
                    I had some qualms about purchasing this time because I was promised a quiet machine from my first vendor and it was anything but quiet.
                    I researched my requirements and proposed Vendors for at least 4 months.
                    I decided that I wanted to find someone local, in case there were any problems, where I could resolve those problems quickly.
                </p><p>Wouter allowed me to come to his facility and have a look and listen to a DAW with very similar components as the one I was interested in.
                    It was quieter than my business DELL that I have and much more powerful than my previous DAW.
                    These guys are conscious of using quality/quiet components in their machines, and it shows.
                </p><p>
                    I can't tell you how pleased I have been with this purchase.
                    I would recommend Reyniers Audio to anyone looking for a new DAW.
                </p>

			Ok, you want service and a superior product? You came to the right place. This is probably the best deal and service I have ever received from an internet business. The computer they built for me is absolutely perfect in every way. I don't have to worry about anything but making music! This box simply rocks! 
                </p><p>
                    Also they are very friendly and eager to help you in any way. You can tell they are passionate about what they do.
                </p>
                <h2>Greg Morris</h2>
                <p>I had a great experience. They were very responsive to my questions, and I immediately got the sense that they were knowledgeable about what they do.
                </p><p>
                    It was hard to wait for the PC in this day and age of instant gratification, but I understand the benefit of rigorous testing. I've been VERY happy with the PC I received. I initially had one minor issue which they quickly responded to and resolved. It has been smooth sailing since.
                </p><p>
                    The product, I think, is reasonably priced as well. A souped up Dell was in the same range, but couldn't touch the Reyniers DAW when used as a recording PC. I would highly recommend.</p>
