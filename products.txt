5	Maestro DX - DAW Recording Computer	"Get the most processing power and memory available in one workstation. The Reyniers Audio Maestro DX is a perfect solution for huge instrument libraries by EastWest, Tascam, Native Instruments, Vienna Symphonic Orchestra, Audio Impressions and more. Never before have composers writing huge orchestral scores been able to do this heavy lifting with just one computer. In the past, multiple computers were needed for the task. Now, with Intel's 8-Core Dual Xeon processors, all of this can be done from one workstation with headroom to spare."	http://www.reyniersaudio.com/index.php?task=browse&view=model&modelId=18	2949	ReyniersAduio	new	http://www.reyniersaudio.com/images/models/full/1256033800.jpg	45	RA MAEDX	Electronics > Computers > Desktops 	1	US::Ground:0	US:FL:7.0:n
