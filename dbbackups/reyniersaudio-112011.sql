Hammerfall DSP MADI is based on the award-winning Hammerfall DSP technology, and represents the top model of this world-wide successful card line.</p>\r\n<p>The PCI card consequently uses all advantages of the MADI format: MADI, the professionals'' multi-Channel audio interface, offers 64 channels of 24-Bit audio at a sample rate of up to 48 kHz and 32 channels at up to 96 kHz. Transmission is done via a single line, either coaxial with BNC plugs or with fiber cable. In both cases more than 100 m cable length can be achieved.</p>\r\n<p>HDSP MADI is fully compatible to all devices with MADI interface. In combination with the ADI-648 an 8 x ADAT optical PC interface is realized, unbeatable in price and performance. With the ADI-6432 a bidirectional AES/EBU frontend with 64 channels is available.</p>\r\n<p>On a powerful PC/Mac <strong>two HDSP MADI</strong> can be used in a combination, providing 128 inputs and 128 outputs on a single workstation simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>RME also offers a PCI Express version: (HDSPe MADI).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>64 Input channels / 64 Output channels</li>\r\n<li>1 x MADI I/O (optical and coaxial)</li>\r\n<li>2 x MIDI I/O</li>\r\n<li>Stereo Analog Out</li>\r\n<li>Word Clock I/O</li>\r\n<li>RME Remote</li>\r\n<li>TotalMix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<p>Hammerfall DSP MADI offers full support for 56 and 64 channel modes and double and single wire technology (96k frame) for 96 kHz. Full 64 channel support can also be found in the hardware mixer TotalMix. All 64 inputs and 64 playback channels can be routed and mixed to 64 physical outputs completely freely, which translates to a 8192 channel mixer. With that, Hammerfall DSP MADI offers the most powerful router/mixer ever implemented on a PCI card, and allows much more than a usage as pure computer I/O unit:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>MADI optical patchbay and router</li>\r\n<li>MADI coaxial/optical or vice versa converter and splitter</li>\r\n<li>MADI redistributor, patchbay and router</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>TotalMix can be completely remote controlled via MIDI. Furthermore, the hardware delivers RMS and peak level meters for full control over 192 audio channels at minimal CPU load.</p>\r\n<p>While most MADI-based devices require an additional word clock or AES line, the Hammerfall DSP MADI (like the ADI-648) uses SteadyClock(TM) to extract the reference clock at lowest jitter directly from the MADI signal, making long-distance connections even more convenient.</p>\r\n<p>As usual with RME, Hammerfall DSP MADI offers further sensible features. For instance an analog 24-Bit/96kHz line/headphone output with 110 dB dynamic range for direct control of all input and output signals.</p>\r\n<p>The included expansion board carries word clock I/O (BNC) and MIDI I/O. The word clock input is galvanically isolated via transformer and operates on both single and double speed signals automatically. MIDI I/O offers two completely independent MIDI inputs and outputs via breakout cable (4 DIN sockets). A virtual MIDI port allows for a direct transmission of MIDI data over MADI.</p>\r\n<p>For the first time, RME uses a configuration memory for the most important settings of the card. Instead of operating in a default mode on computer power-up until loading the driver, Hammerfall DSP MADI activates the last used sample rate, master/slave configuration and MADI format immediately when switched on. This eliminates disturbing noises and clock network problems during power-up or re-boot of the computer.</p>\r\n<p>Included software:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>DIGICheck for Windows: Spectral Analyser, professional level meter for 2, 8, or 64 channels, Vector Audio Scope, various other audio analysis tools.</li>\r\n<li>Drivers: Windows 2000/XP/Vista/64 (full ASIO multi-client operation of MME, GSIF 2.0 and ASIO 2.0, WDM), Mac OS X (Core Audio and Core MIDI).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="specifications">\r\n<p>Just click on the hammer symbol in the systray of the taskbar and the settings dialog of the HDSP MADI comes up.

With this, the device becomes a sync reference for the whole studio. SteadyClock refreshes clock signals, removes jitter, and takes care of optimal AD/DA conversion quality, thus guarantees a sensational sound quality, completely independent from the reference clock''s quality. SteadyClock allows the unit to control the sample rate freely on its own. The Settings dialog includes a direct choice of the video and audio world''s most often used sample rates. Additionally, two faders can be used to set the sample rate freely and in real-time, within the range of +/- 4% and +/- 0.4%.</p>\r\n<p>Of course the Fireface 400 offers a second FireWire port for hub functionality. Up to three devices can be connected to one FireWire interface and operated in parallel. The renowned Fireface 800 shares the same driver, allowing mixed setups.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Analog I/Os</strong>: Eight inputs and outputs (balanced, output 7/8 unbalanced) with software controlled switching of the reference levels (-10 dBV, +4 dBu, Lo/HiGain), of course realized discretely in the analog domain, guarantee highest dynamic range and highest fidelity.</p>\r\n<p>The Fireface 400''s front panel features 2 balanced microphone inputs with a digitally controlled input stage, individually switchable 48 V phantom power, and Neutrik Combo connectors for XLR and TRS. These can also be used as additional Line inputs. A gain of up to 65 dB, adjustable in steps of 1 dB over a range of 55 dB, exceptional EIN performance even at low amplification settings, and extremely low THD+N let these preamps surpass those of other devices that cost several times the price of the Fireface 400. All level settings are 100% reproducible and can also be adjusted by software comfortably.</p>\r\n<p>Inputs 3 and 4 are stunningly flexible balanced universal inputs. Firstly, they operate exactly as inputs 5 to 8 on the rear and can be adjusted to accept standard studio input levels (+4 dBu, LoGain). Furthermore, the input impedance can be switched from Line (10 kOhm) to Instrument (470 kOhm). An additional analog input amplification of up to 18 dB (in steps of 0.5 dB) is also available. In short: There''s no signal that these inputs can''t deal with perfectly!</p>\r\n<p>Inputs 5 to 8 on the rear feature RME''s proven level references. -10 dBV, +4 dBu und LoGain can be selected in the settings dialog, equivalent to +2 dBV, +13 dBu und +19 dBu for digital full scale. The same applies to the balanced rear analog outputs 1 to 6.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>high power phones output</strong>&nbsp;offers high volumes even with low-impedance headphones, and represents playback channels 7/8. All outputs can be used for ASIO Direct Monitoring purposes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Digital I/Os</strong>: An ADAT optical I/O* allows for a connection and insertion of effects devices, mixing consoles or external converters. Of course, these 8 channels are available simultaneously with the analog channels. Using an additional ADI-8 DS or OctaMic D, you''ll get 16 analog inputs and outputs, which remain still 12 at 96 kHz. The coaxial SPDIF I/O, which is fully AES/EBU compatible (as is common for RME), also works up to 192 kHz, which means that at the highest sample rate, 8 analog and two digital inputs and outputs are directly available.

(194, 'Presonus Audiobox 44VSL', '', '<p>24Bit/96kHz<br />4x4 Channels<br />USB 2.0</p>', '<h1>Description</h1>\r\n<p>The AudioBox 44VSL is the second model in a new generation of PreSonus USB 2.0 audio/MIDI interfaces that take hardware/software integration to the logical next step. Using your computer CPU and PreSonus&nbsp;Virtual StudioLive&trade; (VSL) software, AudioBox VSL-series interfaces provide reverb and and delay effects and the same Fat Channel compression, limiting, semi-parametric EQ, and high-pass filter, as the PreSonus&nbsp;StudioLive&trade; 16.0.2digital mixer&mdash; all with inaudible latency.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, thanks to the power of VSL, the AudioBox 44VSL includes an 8x4 software mixer. As a result, with just an AudioBox 44VSL and your laptop or other computer running VSL, you can mix a studio session or a live show featuring, say, a guitar duo with vocals, a small band, a DJ rig with mixer and stereo synthesizer, or a panel discussion&mdash;all while monitoring and recording with or without real-time processing! And you can do it simply and easily, with no hardware mixer, no outboard effects rack, and minimal wiring, thanks to the tight integration between PreSonus hardware and software.</p>\r\n<p>To top it off, while the classic PreSonus AudioBox USB is a fine-sounding unit, the new AudioBox VSL series sounds even better, with 24-bit, 96 kHz recording and top-of-the-line PreSonus XMAX&trade; preamps.</p>\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s so great about effects and processing on monitors?</h2>\r\n<p>Tracking without hearing effects and signal processing is like playing a video game with your eyes closed. Musicians rely on aural cues when performing, and their performance can vary depending on what they hear in their monitors. Adding just the right amount of compression, EQ, and reverb can make a huge difference in their ability to hear themselves clearly and to experience their performance as if it occurred in a natural space rather than in the artificial sonic environment of the studio. The result is a better performance and ultimately a better recording.</p>\r\n<p>You have plenty of effects plug-ins for your DAW, but processing audio with a DAW takes more time than you might think. True, we&rsquo;re talking milliseconds, but it&rsquo;s long enough that if you put DAW effects in your studio monitors, you&rsquo;ll hear the original sound slightly before the processed signal, which is very disorienting. That much delay might be acceptable for live gigs, where the band is playing together in an ambient space that has natural delay. But you can&rsquo;t record that way in the studio.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, our engineering wizards have dramatically reduced processing delay in the AudioBox VSL series. The result: dynamics processing, EQ, reverb, and effects that feel real, with no audible delay.</p>\r\n<p>And if you like what you hear, you can record with AudioBox VSL-series effects, too! These are the same high-quality StudioLive 16.0.2 Fat Channel dynamics processors and EQs that professional musicians, engineers, and producers record with every day.</p>\r\n<h2>Great processors are a PreSonus tradition</h2>\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t invent the first audio interface with effects. We simply did it better and for less money. Sure, some interface manufacturers that don&rsquo;t normally make signal processors have added a compressor, EQ and a few effects to their interfaces. But the AudioBox VSL series provides all that, plus a separate limiter, expander, and high-pass filter&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve been making high-quality signal processors since 1995. The AudioBox VSL-series&rsquo; Virtual StudioLive (VSL)-based effects and Fat Channel processing have been extensively field-tested and proven popular by tens of thousands of StudioLive&trade;-series mixer users, including many top professionals.</p>\r\n<p>Of great importance, thanks to VSL&rsquo;s drag-and-drop convenience, adding processing and creating and loading presets is easy. Pro-level processing and superior ease of use mean you&rsquo;ll get better results and have more fun!</p>\r\n<h2>High-end sound</h2>\r\n<p>Compact and rugged, the AudioBox 44VSL offers two convenient front-panel mic/instrument combo inputs and two mic/instrument combo inputs, global phantom power, and a total of six line-level outputs. It sports the same high-headroom, Class A XMAX preamps as the StudioLive mixers and has 24-bit, 96 kHz converters with 114 dB dynamic range for clear, clean audio. And it boasts PreSonus&rsquo; legendary 120 mW headphone output, which is loud enough to explode the oysters in a Po&rsquo;-Boy sandwich. (Be careful with your level control!)</p>\r\n<p>The superior sound of PreSonus preamplifiers has long been a major reason that so many audio professionals prefer PreSonus interfaces. The XMAX is the finest solid-state preamplifier we make, offering three key advantages:</p>\r\n<li><strong>1. High Voltage.</strong>&nbsp;The XMAX preamplifier runs on power rails of 30V. Most off-the-shelf, op-amp-based designs run on power rails of 10V to 18V. Higher-voltage power rails deliver more headroom, deeper lows, smoother highs, and a richer overall sound.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2. Discrete components</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&mdash; not op-amps.</strong>&nbsp;We only use genuine transistors, resistors, and capacitors for ultra-low noise and transparency. Op-amps add noise, coloration, and harshness to a signal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>3. Class A circuitry.</strong>&nbsp;Class A circuits have no crossover distortion and deliver purer, clearer, and more musical results than the Class AB designs that are found in many preamps.</li>\r\n<p>The net result of the XMAX preamp design is high headroom, low noise, wide dynamic range, extended frequency response, and&mdash;most important&mdash;musicality and transparency, with smooth highs; solid, deep lows; and everything in between.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Built for the rigors of the road</h2>\r\n<p>PreSonus gear has a well-earned reputation for extreme roadworthiness, and the AudioBox 44VSL is no exception. It employs a heavy-duty steel case that is every bit as rugged as that of the smaller AudioBox 22VSL and original&nbsp;AudioBox USB&mdash;the unit we famously stomped, kicked, and drove over with a full-size truck before using it to make a very nice recording. (You can witness this in the video&nbsp;AudioBox USB Built for the Road.) Now&nbsp;that&rsquo;s&nbsp;what we call &ldquo;roadworthy.&rdquo; And it fits in a half-rackspace and can be screw-mounted to a standard rack tray (not included).</p>\r\n<h2>The flexibility and power of software</h2>\r\n<p>VSL enables you to easily manage the processing and mixing from your Mac&reg; or Windows&reg; PC and provides editor/librarian functions, making it simple to create and use a library of presets. To get you started, we&rsquo;ve included the same library of more than 50 Fat Channel presets that comes with StudioLive mixers. These presets were created by professional musicians and engineers and let you instantly set up dynamics processing and EQ for vocals, guitar, and much more.</p>\r\n<p>Seamlessly integrated with the included&nbsp;Studio One&trade; Artist&nbsp;DAW and VSL, the AudioBox 44VSL interface works with virtually all Mac and Windows audio-recording software. And unlike most things nowadays, it&rsquo;s very easy on your budget.</p>\r\n<p>So get the next-generation USB 2.0 interface that gives you real-time, low-latency effects; rock-solid construction; software mixing; and high-end audio for low-end prices: AudioBox 44VSL!</p>\r\n<h1>Features</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>24-bit / 96 kHz 4 x 4 USB 2.0 recording interface</li>\r\n<li>2 dual-purpose, front-panel, mic/instrument input channels with: </li>\r\n<li>Combo XLR mic and balanced &frac14;" instrument input</li>\r\n<li>Class A XMAX&trade; mic / instrument preamp</li>\r\n<li>Individual channel-trim controls with 0 to +35 dBu mic gain range</li>\r\n<li>2 dual-purpose, front-panel, mic/line input channels with: </li>\r\n<li>Combo XLR mic and balanced &frac14;" line input</li>\r\n<li>Class A XMAX&trade; mic preamp</li>\r\n<li>Individual channel-trim controls with 0 to +35 dBu mic gain range</li>\r\n<li>True +48V phantom power for condenser microphones (global)</li>\r\n<li>Mixer control (blends the input signal with the computer playback stream for zero-latency analog monitoring)</li>\r\n<li>Headphone jack with level control</li>\r\n<li>Main-output level control</li>\r\n<li>Power/USB sync LED</li>\r\n<li>LED clip indicator for each channel</li>\r\n<li>Mix, adjust input and playback-returns levels, and add effects and signal processing from your laptop or other computer</li>\r\n<li>Studio One&trade; Artist digital audio workstation software included</li>\r\n<li>Virtual StudioLive&trade; (VSL) control software included; manages: </li>\r\n<li>Near-zero-latency monitoring with extensive signal processing</li>\r\n<li>8 x 4 DSP mixer</li>\r\n<li>StudioLive&trade; 16.0.2 Fat Channel compressor, limiter, expander, high-pass filter, and semi-parametric EQ for each analog input and its DAW return</li>\r\n<li>2 stereo effects buses with reverb and delay</li>\r\n<li>More than 50 Fat Channel DSP presets for enhancing instrument and vocal recordings</li>\r\n<li>Input/Output </li>\r\n<li>1 USB 2.0 port</li>\r\n<li>2 combo XLR / &frac14;&rdquo; mic/instrument inputs</li>\r\n<li>2 combo XLR / &frac14;&rdquo; mic/line inputs</li>\r\n<li>2 balanced &frac14;&rdquo; main (L/R) line outputs</li>\r\n<li>4 balanced &frac14;&rdquo; auxiliary (L/R) line outputs</li>\r\n<li>1 stereo &frac14;&rdquo; headphone output</li>\r\n<li>MIDI In/Out</li>\r\n<li>Digitalia </li>\r\n<li>24-bit resolution and 44.1, 48, 88.2, and 96 kHz sampling rate</li>\r\n<li>Professional-grade A/D/A converters (+114 dBu dynamic range)</li>\r\n<li>Zero-latency analog monitoring with playback/input Mix control knob</li>\r\n<li>Mac&reg;- and Windows&reg;-compatible, including Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and Windows 7</li>\r\n<li>Supports ASIO, Core Audio, Direct Sound (Windows XP), Windows Audio Session API (Windows Vista and Windows 7)</li>\r\n<li>Physical </li>\r\n<li>1/2U rack-mountable (screw-mount to standard rack tray, not included)</li>\r\n<li>Road-rugged construction with all-metal chassis and metal knobs</li>\r\n<li>Weight 2.6 lb.

This allows for eight more channels of preamp via Lightpipe. 2 x 2 S/PDIF handles all your other digital connectivity, and word clock synchronizes ProjectMix with other digital devices.</p>\r\n<p>ProjectMix I/O also serves as a 1 x 1 MIDI interface, allowing your computer to connect with MIDI hardware. Monitoring options include two &frac14;&rdquo; headphone outputs with separate volume controls for working with a partner, as well as two stereo output pairs for routing to monitors, processors and mixdown devices. There&rsquo;s even an A/B headphone source monitoring switch for cueing. ProjectMix I/O brings all of this to your computer with a single, simple FireWire connection.</p>\r\n<h2>Easy to Use</h2>\r\n<p>M-Audio&rsquo;s design team gave a great deal of consideration as to what features would provide the most value in an affordable package. They knew that cutting-edge features like high-resolution 10-bit touch-sensitive moving faders, large LCD display and mic/line switches on all channels were important. They also found that much of the expense of other units on the market owed to a dizzying number of controls that many users find daunting. Our engineers opted for a streamlined design that places some functions under the control of the keyboard and mouse, where they are best suited. The result is a controller that doesn&rsquo;t have much of a learning curve, is much more intuitive to use and comes in at an unbeatable price. Check out ProjectMix I/O for yourself at your local M-Audio dealer. We think you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>\r\n<h2>10-bit Touch-Sensitive Moving Faders</h2>\r\n<p>The motorized touch-sensitive faders on each of ProjectMix I/O&rsquo;s eight channel strips and master strip record and playback your changes, making for seamless mix automation. And touch sensitivity means that when you touch a fader in motion, it immediately disengages for manual control and re-engages automation when you release. This provides for both smoother operation and the elimination of motor burnout prevalent in older technologies. ProjectMix&rsquo;s faders also feature higher resolution than other control surfaces in its price range.</p>\r\n<h2>Transport Control</h2>\r\n<p>Dedicated transport controls are another feature that makes doing sessions with ProjectMix I/O a breeze. You get illuminated controls for record, play, stop, fast forward, and rewind, plus a jog/shuttle wheel and locate buttons for easy project navigation. Sets of keys for in/out points, zoom, region nudge, looping and more will having your flying through sessions with incredible efficiency.</p>\r\n<h2>Channel Strip</h2>\r\n<p>ProjectMix I/O&rsquo;s eight channel strips can map to as many channels as your project by simply pressing the bank +/- and channel +/- controls. Each channel strip features all of the functions you&rsquo;d expect to help you zip through sessions, including buttons for mic/line, record enable, mute, solo, and select. In addition to a touch-sensitive motorized fader, each strip has an endless rotary encoder knob whose function is assigned by one of 15 dedicated buttons for EQ, aux send and more. Related information is displayed in the LCD window directly above each encoder. The encoders and LCD double to control assigned plug-in parameters as well.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<table width="615px">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class="tablehead">Top Features</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>record audio directly into Pro Tools M-Powered (not included) &gt; industry-standard format</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>use with Pro Tools M-Powered, Live, Logic, Cubase, Digital Performer and SONAR &gt; total compatibility</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>10-bit touch-sensitive motorized faders &gt; totally intuitive mixing and editing</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>built-in 18 x 14 FireWire audio interface &gt; no additional hardware required</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>8 phantom-powered mic/line preamps &gt; pro input right on board</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>assignable rotary encoders &gt; control mixes, effects and synths</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>LCD display &gt; full track and parameter readout</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>dedicated transport controls and jog/scrub wheel &gt; seamless session flow</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>ADAT Lightpipe, S/PDIF and word clock I/O &gt; total digital connectivity</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="specifications">\r\n<table width="615px">\r\n<tr class="tablehead">\r\n<td colspan="2"><strong>Line Inputs (Balanced)</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Frequency Response</td>\r\n<td>+/- 0.1dB, 20Hz to 22kHz<br />+/- 0.2dB, 20Hz to 80kHz (192kHz)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</td>\r\n<td>-108dB (A-weighted)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Dynamic Range</td>\r\n<td>108dB (A-weighted)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>THD+N</td>\r\n<td>0.002% (-94dB), 1kHz, -1dBFS</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Crosstalk</td>\r\n<td>&lt;-110dB @ 1kHz</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Maximum Input level</td>\r\n<td>+16.1dBu, typical</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Input Impedance</td>\r\n<td>&gt;20k ohm, balanced</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class="tablehead">\r\n<td colspan="2"><strong>Mic Inputs (Balanced) At Min Gain, No Pad</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Frequency Response</td>\r\n<td>+/- 0.2dB, 20Hz to 22kHz</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (min gain, no pad)</td>\r\n<td>-108dB (A-weighted)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Dynamic Range (min gain, no pad)</td>\r\n<td>108dB (A-weighted)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>THD+N (min gain, no pad)</td>\r\n<td>0.0022% (-93dB) @ -1dBFS, 1kHz</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Crosstalk</td>\r\n<td>&lt; -110dB @ 1kHz</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Maximum Input level</td>\r\n<td>from +28dBu @ min gain, pad on to -45dBu @ max<br />gain, no pad</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Input Impedance</td>\r\n<td>3.7k ohms, balanced, no pad</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Adjustable Gain</td>\r\n<td>&gt;53dB without pad</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pad</td>\r\n<td>-20dB</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class="tablehead">\r\n<td colspan="2"><strong>Inst.

This multi-layer materials kit includes 3 sheets; two 2-layer (4mm thick) and one sheet of our latest generation 3-layer materials, providing superb levels of noise reduction despite the thickness being only 7mm.</p>\r\n<p>This soundproofing kit is designed to reduce the noise emanating from noisy PCs with case sizes ranging from standard ATX up to larger E-ATX and pedestal server cases used by gamers, power-users and small business users.</p>\r\n<h2>Material Features</h2>\r\n<p>These soundproofing materials have been designed to achieve maximum acoustic attenuation over a broad frequency range:</p>\r\n<li><strong>High Transmission Loss</strong><br /> High transmission loss is the composite material''s ability to impede airborne noise. </li>\r\n<li><strong>High Noise Reduction Coefficients</strong><br /> High noise reduction coefficients is the composite material''s ability to absorb airborne sound energy with minimal reflections. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Damping</strong><br /> Damping is the composite material''s ability to attenuate structure-borne vibration on metals and other substrates thereby reducing reradiated noise.</li>\r\n<h2>AcoustiPack ULTIMATE 3-Layer Materials</h2>\r\n<p>In the latest generation of 3-layer composite (Patent Pending), the dense acoustic barrier layer has been ''suspended'' away from the substrate in the center of the acoustic foam. The construction layering is like this: (noise source) acoustic foam -&gt; acoustic barrier -&gt; acoustic foam (then the substrate, which is usually a metal sheet panel).</p>\r\n<p>Acousti Products 3-layer acoustic material design showing suspended barrier layer.</p>\r\n<p>Sound energy first hits the upper foam surface, which is similar to the 2-layer construction, in that it is a low-reflective soundproofing material that is particularly effective at absorbing high frequencies. The sound energy then encounters the central suspended barrier layer, which is decoupled from the substrate. This high-density high-mass layer acts as an <strong>acoustic barrier mass</strong> to the transmission of energy through the material. The 3rd layer of foam acts to suspend the barrier layer a small distance away from the substrate. We have found from both small scale impedance tube and larger scale reverberation chamber acoustic tests that the ''suspended'' central acoustic barrier effectively increases the absorption of low frequency noise (&lt;1kHz). This may well be a result of the <strong>''mass-spring effect''</strong>, where low frequency energy is absorbed by the sound ''moving'' the layer when it is excited by certain resonant frequencies.</p>\r\n<p>The 3-layer materials are attached by a supported self-adhesive directly to the substrate, and have a <strong>damping</strong> effect on panel vibrations. (Hit the side of your PC once fitted, and you will hear a dull ''thud'' sound).</p>\r\n<p>The 3-layer materials in the AcoustiPack&trade; kit range are 7mm thick. Acousti Products also manufacture these composites up to 13mm thickness (and over if required ) for manufactures and OEMs. For example, they have been very successfully used in servers and server cabinets, and tested by many different organizations all over the world since they were first developed.</p>', 130.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0, '2009-10-23 05:46:51', '', 0.00, '', 0.00, '', 0.00, 1, NULL);

This card makes the dream of an&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ll-<strong>I</strong>n-<strong>O</strong>ne solution for every possible application come true. The&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>dvanced-<strong>I</strong>nput-<strong>O</strong>utput interface shines with the latest 192 kHz AD- and DA-converters, with more than 112 dB signal to noise ratio. For the first time, all inputs and outputs are simultaneously operational, even SPDIF (phono) and AES/EBU (XLR). Additional hi-quality analog inputs and outputs can easily be added by favourably priced expansion boards. Of course TotalMix, the unsurpassed flexible routing mixer and SteadyClock, RME''s sensational clock technology with maximum jitter suppression of external clock signals, are on board too. HDSPe AIO also supports the optional TCO for synchronization to timecode (LTC/video). All this combines into a professional ''soundcard'' that the world has not seen before.</p>\r\n<p>HDSPe AIO is the newly developed PCI Express version of the HDSP 9632. A newly developed genuine PCI Express core consequently takes full advantage of the new format, achieving significant performance gains in multitrack audio and lowest latency. Thanks to RME''s secure flash update technology, firmware improvements, adjustments, and bugfixes can be installed easily at any time.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Balanced* stereo analog in- and output, 24-bit/192kHz, &gt; 112 dB SNR</li>\r\n<li>Optional analog expansion boards with 4 balanced in- or outputs</li>\r\n<li>All analog I/Os capable of 192 kHz, constant number of available channels</li>\r\n<li>1 ADAT digital I/O, supporting 192 kHz via S/MUX4 operation</li>\r\n<li>1 SPDIF digital I/O, 192 kHz-capable</li>\r\n<li>1 AES/EBU digital I/O, 192 kHz-capable</li>\r\n<li>1 Stereo headphone output, separate DA-converter and playback device</li>\r\n<li>So up to 18 inputs and 20 outputs can be used simultaneously!</li>\r\n<li>1 MIDI I/O with 16 channels of hi-speed MIDI via breakout cable</li>\r\n<li>DIGICheck, RME''s unique metering- and analysing tool</li>\r\n<li>TotalMix: 760 channel Mixer with 42 bit internal resolution</li>\r\n<li>Native PCI Express - no PCI to PCI Express bridge used</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>* The HDSPe AIO ships in a basic version with analog RCA/phono breakout cables (headphone: TRS jack).

(348, 'Steinberg Cubase 6', '', '', '<p><strong>Cubase 6</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>Steinberg</strong>&nbsp;is a native music production system for Mac OS X and Windows 7. Like its past incarnations, the software combines full-featured audio and MIDI recording and editing, virtual instruments and powerful audio mixing, with the added flexibility of loop- and pattern-based arranging and mixing. Version 6 includes another round of significant new features and upgrades.</p>\r\n<p>The software places emphasis not only on technology and precision, but also on user friendliness, usability and ergonomics. With VST Expression 2, the company raises sequencer-based composing to a whole new level and offers an intuitive and functionally complete MIDI composing and sequencing toolset.</p>\r\n<p>VST Expression Maps allow for working with multiple instrument articulations (e.g. huge orchestra libraries) and introduces an editing concept that is user-customizable and fully integrated with the Key and Score Editors. Instead of handling all MIDI controllers for switching articulations, VST Expression Maps allow seamlessly and transparently integrated editing as well, as full control over multiple articulations.</p>\r\n<p>The software includes a huge set of VST MIDI plug-ins, creative tools, such as the drum step sequencer, the Beat Designer, a powerful arpeggiator, a MIDI pattern sequencer and a MIDI chord processor, and more. The Cubase Sample Editor allows for almost limitless creative freedom while editing audio with a full editing toolset that offers a huge range of functions.</p>\r\n<p>The list could go on and on. Instead, please refer to the feature set to get a complete overview of everything the software can do. Cubase 6 has taken the concept of a complete virtual studio (in the box) to levels that were only a dream a decade ago. The user only needs to supply a computer, an I/O interface and monitoring to have access to virtually every tool possible to create professional audio, including working with surround.</p>\r\n<h1>What''s New in Cubase 6</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Drum Editing (Faster with Less Clicks)</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Intelligent Transient Detection</strong></p>\r\n<li>Based on a state-of-the-art algorithm</li>\r\n<li>Finding all drum hits is easy with intuitive preview feature and two specialized filters, called Peak and Beats</li>\r\n<li>Detect single hits, rolls and ghost notes faster and more accurate than before</li>\r\n<li>After the transients have been detected they are merged across multiple tracks by taking user definable priority of individual tracks into account</li>\r\n<li>The drum hits are then cut up and grouped together ready for detailed tweaking - in this way, copying a great fill from verse 2 to verse 1 is solved with minimum effort - select one, move them all</li>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Advanced Tempo Detection </strong></p>\r\n<li>Newly developed tempo detection algorithm, which accurately and semi-automatically determines the tempo of any rhythmic audio material, making it easy to determine the tempo of a drum performance that has not been recorded to a metronome</li>\r\n<li>The resulting tempo map can be used to keep the dynamic feeling of natural tempo variations or to remove unwanted tempo changes quickly</li>\r\n<li>Whatever rhythm is at hand, the software will detect the tempo and match the track to a beat grid of your choice</li>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Multi-Track Audio Quantization </strong></p>\r\n<li>Rhythmic audio material can be quantized just like any MIDI material, offering numerous possibilities to fix timing issues and to change the groove of live-recorded drums</li>\r\n<li>To preserve phase relationships between tracks, the individual slices on all tracks are still grouped and moved at once</li>\r\n<li>Cubase automatically creates cross-fades between slices to ensure seamless transitions between them and fill gaps that might be introduced during quantization</li>\r\n<li>A few clicks, and all drum tracks are matched to the bass drum, snare or whatever source or sources are desired</li>\r\n<li>With the Slice Rules you can decide which sources will get a higher priority during slicing</li>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Straightforward Drum Replacement </strong></p>\r\n<li>Hitpoint-to-MIDI function makes it very easy to replace, double or enrich live-recorded drum sounds</li>\r\n<li>When the transients have been detected, a single click on the Create MIDI Notes button creates a MIDI track containing a MIDI note for each single drum hit</li>\r\n<li>It''s then up to the user which sampler or synthesizer they want to fuel with the note - one choice could be the included Groove Agent ONE drum sampler</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Comp the Perfect Take</h2>\r\n<p><strong><br />Lane Track </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>New Lane Track concept for lightning fast multi-take compositing</li>\r\n<li>When recording several takes, the software instantly creates a Lane Track for each take</li>\r\n<li>Simply swipe across the best parts of a take and Cubase automatically creates a master take that contains all selected parts</li>\r\n<li>For comfortable compositing, each Lane Track sports a solo button and full editing functionality</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Track Grouping</h2>\r\n<p><strong><br />Track Edit Groups </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>The Track Edit Groups tool refines working with multi-track recordings by allowing multi-track editing with single-click actions</li>\r\n<li>Whether it is guitar, bass or ambient recording, sound engineers mix several signals to get the best results (when recording a guitar for example, it is common to record signals from different amps or microphone types on separate tracks)</li>\r\n<li>With Track Edit Groups activated, related tracks are tied together and can be edited at once, making this feature a huge time-saver</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>VST Expression 2</h2>\r\n<p><strong><br />Maximum Expression on Every Note </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>Assign, create and edit multiple controller values directly on single note-level, all in a single handy graphical interface</li>\r\n<li>The perfect choice for demanding orchestral arrangements and creating unique sound effects, Note Expression allows controller values to be drawn directly onto single note events in the Key Editor</li>\r\n<li>Because each individual note event contains its own set of controller data, even polyphonic sounding notes can now be dynamically controlled, fully independent from each other</li>\r\n<li>Composers can access controller information such as volume or pitch bend in one place, making it easy to scale, shift or delete several values at once</li>\r\n<li>When moving or copying a note event, the associated controller data will follow as well - each single note event and controllers are treated as one unit, which makes working with instrument articulations faster and more intuitive</li>\r\n<li>Breaking the traditional MIDI limitations opens up entirely new creative possibilities - imagine a chord containing different filter sweeps, volume curves or dynamic expressions for every single note</li>\r\n<li>From ultra-realistic instrument sounds to the most unexpected sonic spheres, VST 3.5 and Note Expression enable a whole new creative approach to composition and sound design</li>\r\n<li>Use VariAudio together with Note Expression to bring lifeless MIDI recordings to life -with the Extract MIDI feature inside the Sample Editor the user can make snapshots of the pitch and volume curves of monophonic audio recordings and paste that information into MIDI notes</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Dynamics</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>The VST Expression set has been extended and now also sports dynamics in the Key Editor</li>\r\n<li>From pianissimo to crescendo and fortissimo, all dynamics from the Score Editor are available in the new Articulations/Dynamics Lane in the Key Editor</li>\r\n<li>When using VST 3.5-compatible instruments, instant acoustic feedback is available from parts that contain dynamics</li>\r\n<li>Dynamics Mapping feature allows very fine adjustments for up to three controllers for dynamics, including velocity, volume and freely assignable MIDI CC</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>VST Expression Map</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>VST 3.5 compatible instruments such as the included HALion Sonic SE, as well as HALion Sonic and the HALion Symphonic Orchestra VST Sound Instrument Set can automatically transfer the articulation setup of each individual instrument sound to a VST Expression Map, a function that will dramatically speed up the setup of VST Expression maps</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Processing and Instruments</h2>\r\n<p><strong><br />VST Amp Rack </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li>Featuring the best in convolution technology, VST Amp Rack delivers a comprehensive collection of outstanding guitar tones across an array of genres and styles, from vintage to modern, available with the simple push of a button</li>\r\n<li>Based on some of the finest guitar amplifiers ever created, the rack comes with 7 distinct amplifier models that exactly reproduce the unique character of their

(350, 'RME HDSPe MADI', '', '<p>24Bit/192kHz<br />128-Channel MADI<br />PCI-E Card</p>', '<ul class="tabnav">\r\n<li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="#features">Features</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="#specifications">Specifications</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class="tabcontent">\r\n<div class="overview">\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>HDSPe MADI</strong>&nbsp;is RME''s both inexpensive and outstanding PCI Express card with MADI interface. HDSPe MADI is based on the award-winning HDSP MADI card, and represents the new top model of this world-wide successful card line.</p>\r\n<p>The PCI Express card consequently uses all advantages of the MADI format, the professionals'' multi-Channel audio interface, offering 64 channels of 24-bit audio at a sample rate of up to 48 kHz, 32 channels at up to 96 kHz and 16 channels at up to 192 kHz. Transmission is done via a single line, either coaxial with BNC plugs or by fiber cable. In both cases more than 100 m cable length can be achieved.</p>\r\n<p>Compared with the&nbsp;HDSP MADI&nbsp;(Standard PCI version), the express card offers some new features: Support of higher sample rates than 96 kHz, more features in TotalMix (phase and internal loopback per channel, +6 dB gain for the hardware outputs), and the direct support of the&nbsp;Time Code Option. HDSPe MADI provides even lower latencies, making the card the perfect partner for live recording and live mixing applications. The analog monitor output is equipped with the low-latency converter technology of the&nbsp;ADI-8 QS, thus guaranteeing stunning SNR and THD values too.</p>\r\n<p>HDSPe MADI is fully compatible to all devices with MADI interface. In combination with the&nbsp;ADI-648&nbsp;an 8 x ADAT optical PC interface is realized, unbeatable in price and performance. With the&nbsp;ADI-6432&nbsp;a bidirectional AES/EBU frontend with 64 channels is available.</p>\r\n<p>On a powerful PC/Mac&nbsp;<strong>three HDSPe MADI</strong>&nbsp;can be used in a combination, providing 192 inputs and 192 outputs on a single workstation simultaneously.</p>\r\n<h2>Connectivity</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>PCI Express Interface</li>\r\n<li>64 Input channels / 64 Output channels</li>\r\n<li>1 x MADI I/O (optical and coaxial)</li>\r\n<li>2 x MIDI I/O</li>\r\n<li>Stereo Analog Out</li>\r\n<li>Word Clock I/O</li>\r\n<li>TotalMix</li>\r\n<li>optional:&nbsp;HDSP TCO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Differences to HDSP MADI</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>PCI Express interface</li>\r\n<li>Sample rates up to 192 kHz</li>\r\n<li>Even lower latencies</li>\r\n<li>Enhanced TotalMix</li>\r\n<li>Monitor output with low-latency converter technology of&nbsp;ADI-8 QS</li>\r\n<li>Direct support of&nbsp;HDSP TCO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<p>HDSPe MADI offers full support for 56 and 64 channel modes and double and single wire technology (96k frame) for 96 kHz. Full 64 channel support can also be found in the hardware mixer&nbsp;TotalMix. All 64 inputs and 64 playback channels can be routed and mixed to 64 physical outputs completely freely, which translates to a 8192 channel mixer. With that, HDSPe MADI offers the most powerful router/mixer ever implemented on a PCI card, and allows much more than a usage as pure computer I/O unit:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>MADI optical patchbay and router</li>\r\n<li>MADI coaxial/optical or vice versa converter and splitter</li>\r\n<li>MADI redistributor, patchbay and router</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>TotalMix can be completely remote controlled via MIDI. Furthermore, the hardware delivers RMS and peak level meters for full control over 192 audio channels at minimal CPU load.</p>\r\n<p>While most MADI-based devices require an additional word clock or AES line, the Hammerfall DSP MADI (like the&nbsp;ADI-648) usesSteadyClock(TM)&nbsp;to extract the reference clock at lowest jitter directly from the MADI signal, making long-distance connections even more convenient. As usual with RME, HDSPe MADI offers further sensible features. For instance an analog 24-bit/96 kHz line/headphone output with 116 dB dynamic range for direct control of all input and output signals.</p>\r\n<p>The included expansion board carries word clock I/O (BNC) and MIDI I/O. The word clock input is galvanically isolated via transformer and operates on both single and double speed signals automatically. MIDI I/O offers two completely independent MIDI inputs and outputs via breakout cable (4 DIN sockets). A virtual MIDI port allows for a direct transmission of MIDI data over MADI.</p>\r\n<p>RME uses a configuration memory for the most important settings of the card. Instead of operating in a default mode on computer power-up until loading the driver, HDSPe MADI activates the last used sample rate, master/slave configuration and MADI format immediately when switched on. This eliminates disturbing noises and clock network problems during power-up or re-boot of the computer.</p>\r\n<p>Included software:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>DIGICheck&nbsp;for Windows: Spectral Analyser, professional level meter for 2, 8, or 64 channels, Vector Audio Scope, various other audio analysis tools.</li>\r\n<li>Drivers: Windows 2000/XP/Vista/64 (full ASIO multi-client operation of WDM, GSIF 2.0 and ASIO 2.0), Mac OS X Intel (Core Audio and Core MIDI).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thanks to RME''s flash update technology, future firmware improvements, adjustments, and bugfixes can be installed easily at any time.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="specifications">\r\n<p>Just click on the hammer symbol in the systray of the taskbar and the settings dialog of the HDSPe MADI comes up. The clear structured, easy to understand window plus the unique informative status windows for input signal, clock mode and sample rate make your work with Hammerfall DSP to a real pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>When working with several digital sources it is not only necessary to know if these are properly locked, but also if they are totally synchronized. RME''s exclusive SyncCheck &reg; checks all input signals and displays their actual state, and thanks to our new Intelligent Clock Control (ICC) concept you have all clocks and states under control - with ease.</p>\r\n<p>HDSPe MADI is equipped with SteadyClock(TM), RME''s unique sync and clock technology. With this, the device becomes a sync reference for the whole studio. SteadyClock refreshes clock signals, removes jitter, and takes permanent care of optimal conversion quality, thus guarantees a sensational sound quality, completely independent from the reference clock''s quality.</p>\r\n<p>SteadyClock allows the HDSPe MADI to control the sample rate freely on its own. The Settings dialog includes a direct choice of the video and audio world''s most often used sample rates. Additionally, two faders can be used to set the sample rate freely and in real-time, within the range of +/- 4% and +/- 0.4%.</p>\r\n<h2>Tech Specs</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>1-Lane PCI Express Endpoint device</strong>&nbsp;(no PCI Express to PCI Bridge), revision 1.1.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2.5 Gbps line speed</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Packet-based full-duplex communication</strong>&nbsp;(up to 500 MB/s transfer rate)</li>\r\n<li><strong>All settings</strong>&nbsp;changeable in real-time</li>\r\n<li><strong>Automatic&nbsp;</strong>and intelligent master/slave clock control</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sync sources:</strong>&nbsp;MADI coaxial, MADI optical, word clock, internal</li>\r\n<li><strong>Varipitch:</strong>&nbsp;by input signal or word clock</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sample rates:</strong>&nbsp;44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, 192 kHz, variable (Sync/word clock)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sample rate range:</strong>&nbsp;MADI: 32 kHz - 96 kHz, word clock: 27 kHz - 200 kHz</li>\r\n<li><strong>Jitter:</strong>&nbsp;&lt; 1 ns, internal and all inputs</li>\r\n<li><strong>Jitter sensitivity:</strong>&nbsp;PLL operates even at 100 ns Jitter without problems</li>\r\n<li><strong>Comes with DIGICheck:</strong>&nbsp;the ultimate measurement, analysis and test tool</li>\r\n<li><strong>Input</strong>&nbsp;MADI optical, MADI coaxial (BNC), 2 x MIDI, word clock (BNC)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Output</strong>&nbsp;MADI optical, MADI coaxial (BNC), 2 x MIDI, word clock (BNC), stereo analog line/phones</li>\r\n<li><strong>Input word clock:</strong>&nbsp;BNC, Signal Adaptation Circuit (functional from 1.2 Vpp input signal), switchable termination</li>\r\n<li><strong>Output word clock:</strong>&nbsp;BNC, low-impedance driver stage, 4 Vpp into 75 Ohms, short-circuit-proof</li>\r\n<li><strong>MIDI input and output:</strong>&nbsp;via four 5-pin DIN jacks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 1599.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0, '2011-04-22 23:25:11', '', 0.00, '', 0.00, '', 0.00, 1, 'Brand::RME,,Form Factor::Internal,,Format::PCI-E,,Total Inputs::64,,Total Outputs::66,,Analog Inputs::,,Analog Outputs::2,,Digital I/O::64/64,,MIDI I/O::2/2,,Microphone Preamps::,,Sample Rate::192kHz,,Headphone outs::,,Included Software::'),

At its heart is a bright multifunctional color display with full front-panel metering for all 60 channels plus effect bus, and complete control of all key features - directly from the front of the UFX.</p>\r\n<h2>Sound Quality</h2>\r\n<p>The Fireface UFX, like any other RME product, combines excellent analog circuit design with high-grade AD/DA converter chips. Therefore, all balanced TRS &amp; XLR I/Os and both Phones (TRS - Stereo) outputs guarantee outstanding low noise and distortion values. In RME''s typical tradition and product philosophy, converters and preamps don''t produce sound. They do not add or remove anything from the source signal - just capture it as it is.</p>\r\n<p>Equipped with the latest A/D and D/A converter chips, all I/Os on the Fireface UFX operate up to 192kHz and reach 118 dBA dynamic range on playback - even both headphone outputs. Their high-power technology delivers high volume no matter if high- or low-impedance phones are used. The balanced analog inputs are based on RME''s low-latency converter design from the high-end converter ADI-8 QS. The DA section is based on RME''s M-series. Both designs guarantee excellent S/N and THD specs across a wide analog level range.</p>\r\n<p>Due to its efficient jitter reduction, RME''s superior SteadyClock finalizes the state-of-the-art AD/DA conversion, even when clocking to an external digital source.</p>\r\n<p>Every input and output is individually switchable to common professional studio levels: -10 dBV, +4 dBu, HiGain (equivalent to +2 dBV, +13 dBu, and +19 dBu for digital full scale) - directly on the device or via TotalMix. The balanced XLR outputs even provide a level of up to +24 dBu. All outputs can be used for ASIO Direct Monitoring purposes.</p>\r\n<h2>Preamps</h2>\r\n<p>The UFX has four high-transparency preamps backed up by four stereo converters with RME''s new parallel converter technology.</p>\r\n<p>The microphone and instrument preamps of the UFX use the core technology from RME''s Micstasy - a high-end preamp for supreme sonic demands and critical applications, like the professional recording of classical concerts. The fully symmetrical preamp design impresses with extremely low distortion, excellent signal-to-noise ratio and a perfect linear frequency response. A premium solution for transmitting and amplifying any audio input truly unchanged, be it high-level stage or typical studio signals, lower level and high-impedance instruments, or dynamic, condenser, and ribbon microphones.</p>\r\n<p>The digitally controlled gain of up to 65 dB, adjustable in steps of 1 dB over a range of 55 dB, is individually set for every preamp by the display-supported controls on the front of the UFX. All level settings are 100% reproducible and can also be adjusted comfortably within the TotalMix software on the host computer or by a MIDI remote controller.</p>\r\n<p>The four inputs on the front use balanced XLR/TRS combo sockets and operate alternatively as Hi-Z inputs. Directly plug in up to four guitars or other instruments with no other hardware required. Each channel can be individually switched to 48V phantom power or instrument level. LEDs for signal, clip, TRS operation, and activated phantom power give a complete overview on the unit''s status.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Parallel Conversion</h2>\r\n<p>The four UFX preamps are feeding not only four, but eight AD converters. Every microphone channel uses a double, parallel AD conversion on two AD converters at the same time to reach exceptional signal-to-noise values and a performance not available with a classic converter design.</p>\r\n<p>The UFX follows RME''s tradition of providing flexible and expandable audio systems. Adding additional preamplifiers or more analog inputs is easily done via the dual ADAT optical I/Os on the rear.</p>\r\n<h2>TotalMix FX</h2>\r\n<p>The DSP-based TotalMix mixer allows fully independent routing and mixing of all 30 input and playback channels to all 30 physical outputs. Up to 15 totally independent stereo submixes plus a comprehensive Control Room section offer incredible monitoring capabilities and routing flexibility.</p>\r\n<p>This next generation of TotalMix delivers hardware mixing/routing with lots of new features and a highly improved usability. For a seamless integration of the new features TotalMix FX, has been rewritten from the ground up.</p>\r\n<p>Every input and output channel comes with a luxury feature set, comparable to a full-scale digital console. The effects per channel include 3-band parametric EQ, adjustable Low Cut, Auto Level, Compressor, Expander, MS Processing, and phase reversal. The Reverb and Echo effects unit is available for all channels by a stereo send and return bus. All these effects are available even at 192 kHz operation. Two DSPs ensure an impressive performance even in extreme applications. As usual with RME, TotalMix is available with all channels (90) at all sample rates, completely unlimited. The second DSP calculates the effects only so it has sufficient resources. For example, at 48 kHz, 60 EQs, 34 Low Cuts, and Echo can all be activated. With activated Reverb and Echo, you can still use 46 EQs and 32 Low Cuts.</p>\r\n<p>The FX-DSP uses automatic overload surveillance. As soon as no effect can be added anymore, the TotalMix surface will clearly let you know. When changing to higher sample rates, the UFX automatically deactivates all effects that exceed the DSP''s performance - the DSP will never be overloaded. This also prevents the user from destroyed loudspeakers.</p>\r\n<p>The complete effects section not only adds a lot of flexibility to the recording chain, but makes latency-burdened software dispensable. TotalMix can easily replace any external mixer, e.g. to create different latency-free monitoring mixes with EQ and Reverb for the main studio monitors and the headphone of the vocalist(s) in the recording room. Furthermore, the DSP hardware calculates RMS and Peak levels for all 90 level meters, so there is zero CPU load on the host.</p>\r\n<p>The main functions of TotalMix can be remote controlled via MIDI with any Mackie Control compatible controller (sold separately).</p>\r\n<h2>Monitor Controller</h2>\r\n<p>The UFX is not only a perfect desktop level controller, but a monitor switcher and source selector with integrated talkback function for modern Mix-In-the-Box studios. As the UFX includes the usually externally added monitoring controller, it also preserves the original sound, as its hardware output stays directly connected to the studio monitors.</p>\r\n<h2>Level Control</h2>\r\n<p>The big rotary encoder on the front of the UFX maintains precisely controls the three dedicated stereo monitor outputs: Main Out, Phones 1, and Phones 2. Start turning the volume encoder and the display shows the current gain value in big numbers. The small encoder buttons provide direct access to pan and reverb for the selected output. Pushing the volume knob switches between the outputs.</p>\r\n<h2>Monitor Management</h2>\r\n<p>The above gain (volume) settings at the unit work hand in hand with the Control Room section of TotalMix FX. Any physical output can be assigned to the three, directly knob-controlled monitor outputs. For example, just assign the AES/EBU output as Main Out, or as Phones Out - any output can be used. The functions Talkback, Listenback, Mono, and Dim will work automatically for the assigned outputs in the expected way.</p>\r\n<h2>USB &amp; FireWire</h2>\r\n<p>With the release of the Fireface 800 in 2004, RME stirred up the FireWire audio market, setting benchmarks and providing a superior solution with a unique feature set. It is no surprise many customers and testers respect RME as one of the references and technology leaders for FireWire audio interfaces. In 2009, RME released the Fireface UC, a USB solution which again provided an exceptional performance, previously not available from USB audio interfaces.</p>\r\n<p>The secret of success: RME is the only manufacturer not to use a third-party USB or FireWire audio technology, but a self-developed Hammerfall Audio Core with an outstanding performance and pro audio features.</p>\r\n<p>The Fireface UFX now combines USB and FireWire, both made by RME, within one interface.</p>\r\n<h2>USB 2.0</h2>\r\n<p>The Fireface UFX has been uncompromisingly optimized for highest performance under Windows and Mac OS. It uses a special customized firmware for every operating system. Like other RME USB 2.0* interfaces, the UFX provides revolutionary ultra-low latencies even with multiple channels.</p>\r\n<p>The Fireface UFX is compatible to USB 3 chipsets.</p>\r\n<h2>FireWire</h2>\r\n<p>The completely redesigned FireWire core provides the UFX with the same exceptional compatibility and performance as RME''s USB solution. For the first time, the UFX does not have any FireWire chip inside at all - it''s completely programmed into the FPGA, under direct control of the RME masterminds, and updated by a simple firmware update - if ever necessary. This new technology is even compatible to Agere''s infamous rev. 6 chip.</p>\r\n<h2>Usability-Display</h2>\r\n<p>In search of an exceptional usability experience for the huge feature set, RME integrates a high-resolution color display into the front panel. In combination with three rotary encoders, all important features of the UFX can be manually controlled directly on the UFX itself. TotalMix, connected PC or Mac, is synced to the interface controls and follows all changes automatically.</p>\r\n<h2>Smart control</h2>\r\n<p>The four keys, the two encoders 1 and 2, the high-resolution, and clear color display, and a well thought-out menu structure, enable you to quickly change and configure all the device''s settings even without a computer. Help notes and clear markers in the display guide you through all functions.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<h2>Features</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New design and improved usability</li>\r\n<li>Improved Control Room section for the main output (studio monitors) and phones</li>\r\n<li>Cue for quick listening to other outputs</li>\r\n<li>Separated monitor panel</li>\r\n<li>Four mute, solo and fader groups each</li>\r\n<li>Switchable mono and stereo channel view</li>\r\n<li>New channel options: Stereo Width, MS Processing, Phase L/R</li>\r\n<li>Trim Mode: Adjusts the volume for all routed signals of a channel which allows you to modify the volume of all sends of a channel simultaneously, equalling a hardware''s trim functionality.</li>\r\n<li>Unlimited Undo and Redo</li>\r\n<li>FX Sends and Returns: One send bus for every input/playback channel with Reverb/Echo</li>\r\n<li>Expandable channel view for channel settings, EQ, and Dynamics setup</li>\r\n<li>Slim channel mode for selected or all channels to save space or give a meter bridge view</li>\r\n<li>2-Row Mode: reduces the height of the mixer to two rows for smaller displays</li>\r\n<li>Extended Matrix window with mono/stereo mode, Undo/Redo, display of phase and mute</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Connectivity</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>30 Input / 30 Output channels</li>\r\n<li>12 x Analog I/O</li>\r\n<li>4 x Mic/Instrument Preamp, digitally controlled</li>\r\n<li>1 x AES/EBU I/O</li>\r\n<li>2 x ADAT I/O (or 1 x ADAT I/O plus 1 x SPDIF I/O optical)</li>\r\n<li>1 x Word Clock I/O</li>\r\n<li>2 x MIDI I/O</li>\r\n<li>1 x FireWire 400</li>\r\n<li>1 x USB 2.0</li>\r\n<li>TotalMix FX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="specifications">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> System Requirements for drivers </strong></li>\r\n<li>Windows 7 / Vista / XP SP2 (32 &amp;

L22 provides two 192 kHz analog channels and two 96kHz digital channels with the same audio engine as LynxTWO. And although it only has four channels total, L22 uses the LynxTWO&rsquo;s 16-channel software mixer and can add I/O channels using the optional LS-ADAT and LS-AES LStream daughter cards.</p>\r\n<p>The L22 is an excellent choice for mastering and broadcast facilities where quality and stability are crucial. This professional audio interface card is also intended for use in the most demanding audio recording, post-production, and measurement applications.</p>\r\n<p>Using proprietary circuit topologies and custom components in the analog stages along with the latest converter technology, the L22 achieves a 117 dB dynamic range. Most importantly, advanced noise-rejection design techniques are incorporated to maintain this performance from computer to computer.</p>\r\n<p>The onboard digital mixer is extremely flexible allowing the L22 to adapt to any studio or workstation configuration. Each of the mixer''s 16 outputs is capable of mixing signals from 16 physical inputs or 16 playback tracks with 32-bit precision.</p>\r\n<p>As with other Lynx products, the L22 provides unprecedented compatibility with a wide range of platforms and operating systems.

Introduced in 2000, these three versatile cards offered 192 kHz analog audio and 96 kHz digital audio with world-class converters and time code synchronization on board. With performance that exceeds many stand-alone converters, LynxTWO has set the standard for signal purity, versatile synchronization, powerful hardware mixing, and extensibility to support a variety of multichannel formats including ADAT and multiple AES/EBU or SPDIF.</p>\r\n<p>The three models offer different analog I/O configurations for versatility and ease of use. The basic LynxTWO-A model, with four analog inputs and outputs, is intended for general usage. LynxTWO-B, with two analog inputs and six analog outputs, is an excellent choice for playback of 5.1 audio or any application where six outputs are necessary, often precluding the need for a second or third card. With its six analog inputs and two analog outputs, the LynxTWO-C is an excellent choice for remote recording systems.</p>\r\n<p>LynxTWO&rsquo;s powerful 16-channel mixer allows extensive routing, control and metering with excellent visual reference. With the latest software, you can mix up to four inputs to any of 16 outputs.

Introduced in 2000, these three versatile cards offered 192 kHz analog audio and 96 kHz digital audio with world-class converters and time code synchronization on board. With performance that exceeds many stand-alone converters, LynxTWO has set the standard for signal purity, versatile synchronization, powerful hardware mixing, and extensibility to support a variety of multichannel formats including ADAT and multiple AES/EBU or SPDIF.</p>\r\n<p>The three models offer different analog I/O configurations for versatility and ease of use. The basic LynxTWO-A model, with four analog inputs and outputs, is intended for general usage. LynxTWO-B, with two analog inputs and six analog outputs, is an excellent choice for playback of 5.1 audio or any application where six outputs are necessary, often precluding the need for a second or third card. With its six analog inputs and two analog outputs, the LynxTWO-C is an excellent choice for remote recording systems.</p>\r\n<p>LynxTWO&rsquo;s powerful 16-channel mixer allows extensive routing, control and metering with excellent visual reference. With the latest software, you can mix up to four inputs to any of 16 outputs. In addition to the inputs and outputs on the LynxTWO, the mixer incorporates program material from the optional LS-ADAT or LS-AES daughter cards or from Aurora converters.</p>\r\n<p>With a design very similar to that of Lynx&rsquo;s highly acclaimed Aurora converters, LynxTWO delivers near Aurora-quality specs and performance in the compact PCI card format. In fact, using the optional LynxTWO/Aurora Interface Kit, your LynxTWO can act as the computer interface and front end for the Aurora converter.</p>\r\n<p>If you want the same audio quality of the LynxTWO, but only need two channels and do not need SMTPE capabilities, check out the L22.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>200kHz sample rate / 100kHz analog bandwidth (Supported with all drivers)</li>\r\n<li>+4dBu or -10dBV line levels selectable per channel pair</li>\r\n<li>24-bit AES3 or S/PDIF I/O with full status and subcode support</li>\r\n<li>Up to 8 LynxTWOs can be installed in one Windows computer;

Introduced in 2000, these three versatile cards offered 192 kHz analog audio and 96 kHz digital audio with world-class converters and time code synchronization on board. With performance that exceeds many stand-alone converters, LynxTWO has set the standard for signal purity, versatile synchronization, powerful hardware mixing, and extensibility to support a variety of multichannel formats including ADAT and multiple AES/EBU or SPDIF.</p>\r\n<p>The three models offer different analog I/O configurations for versatility and ease of use. The basic LynxTWO-A model, with four analog inputs and outputs, is intended for general usage. LynxTWO-B, with two analog inputs and six analog outputs, is an excellent choice for playback of 5.1 audio or any application where six outputs are necessary, often precluding the need for a second or third card. With its six analog inputs and two analog outputs, the LynxTWO-C is an excellent choice for remote recording systems.</p>\r\n<p>LynxTWO&rsquo;s powerful 16-channel mixer allows extensive routing, control and metering with excellent visual reference. With the latest software, you can mix up to four inputs to any of 16 outputs. In addition to the inputs and outputs on the LynxTWO, the mixer incorporates program material from the optional LS-ADAT or LS-AES daughter cards or from Aurora converters.</p>\r\n<p>With a design very similar to that of Lynx&rsquo;s highly acclaimed Aurora converters, LynxTWO delivers near Aurora-quality specs and performance in the compact PCI card format. In fact, using the optional LynxTWO/Aurora Interface Kit, your LynxTWO can act as the computer interface and front end for the Aurora converter.</p>\r\n<p>If you want the same audio quality of the LynxTWO, but only need two channels and do not need SMTPE capabilities, check out the L22.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="features"><strong>Features</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>200kHz sample rate / 100kHz analog bandwidth (Supported with all drivers)</li>\r\n<li>+4dBu or -10dBV line levels selectable per channel pair</li>\r\n<li>24-bit AES3 or S/PDIF I/O with full status and subcode support</li>\r\n<li>Up to 8 LynxTWOs can be installed in one Windows computer;

Mounted next to the primary card, the LS-ADAT is controlled from the Lynx Mixing Application that is already present. This powerful mixer allows the 16 ADAT inputs to be routed to any output and any of the AES16, LynxTWO or L22s analog or digital input signals to be routed to the LS-ADAT&rsquo;s 16 Lightpipe channels. LS-ADAT installs in an empty bracket internally in your computer, no PCI slot is required.</p>\r\n<p>With four Lightpipe ports on the front (two for input and two for output), 16 input and 16 output channels are available at sample rates up to 48 kHz. Eight channels at 96 kHz and four channels at 192 kHz are available using S/MUX technology.</p>\r\n<p>The ADAT Sync In port provides two methods of sample accurate synchronization, ASIO and LS-ADAT&rsquo;s built-in cue point capability. LS-ADAT offers a wide variety of sample clock options. Its sample clock can be derived from a word clock or composite video received by the LynxTWO. Also either Lightpipe input or the Sync port can be selected as the clock source. When the AES16 is selected as clock source, the LS-ADAT benefits from the extremely low jitter of the AES16&rsquo;s SynchroLock word clock.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="specifications">\r\n<table width="615px">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="3" class="tablehead"><strong>ADAT Optical I/O</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Number / Type</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Two inputs and two outputs, compatible with Alesis ADAT Type I and Type II Optical Digital Interface Protocol, up to 24-bit data</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Channels</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">16 @ 44.1kHz 48 kHz sample rates<br />8 @ 88.2 kHz and 96 kHz sample rates, S/MUX enabled<br />4 @ 176.4 kHz and 192 kHz sample rates, SMUX enabled</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Input Receiver</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Fast-locking phase-locked loop with 30 kHz to 55 kHz lock range</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="3" class="tablehead"><strong>ADAT Synchronization I/O</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Number / Type</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">One 9-pin Sync In port compatible with Alesis Synchronization Protocol</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Signals</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Time code (sample count), word clock, and MIDI control data</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Sample Accurate Methods</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">ASIO Positioning Protocol and hardware-based SMPTE frame address matching logic (Cue Point).</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>MTC</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Time code to MTC conversion</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>MIDI</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">MIDI port transfers serial input control data</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="3" class="tablehead"><strong>Clock Synchronization</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Clock Sources</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Host card (LynxTWO/L22/AES16), Optical In 1, Optical In 2, ADAT Sync In</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Modes</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">Master mode: utilizes LynxTWO/L22/AES16 low-jitter sample clock to drive external ADAT devices<br />Slave mode: word clock derived from external ADAT device</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="3" class="tablehead"><strong>Architecture</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Core</strong></td>\r\n<td colspan="2">FPGA-based core.

This is also where programs will be installed. It is recommended that only software reside on this drive. Everything else (project files, samples, documents, swap files) should be stored on a second drive for optimal performance. This setup is an integral part of our tweak package.<br /> <br /> The <strong>"Project Hard  Drive"</strong> is the drive used for storing your projects, and swap files. This drive has to perform at optimal speeds at all times to ensure crackle-free, low latency playback. Thus,  separating them from the system drive is crucial.<br /><br />The <strong>"Sample Hard  Drive"</strong> is the drive used for storing sample files. If you plan on using multiple VSTi using hyper-sampled instrument libraries placing the sample files on an isolated drive will ensure samples can be pulled from the library without interrupting the system and project drives.&nbsp; This is crucial for low latency when using big libraries such as The Grand, EastWest libaries, Gigastudio, etc..</p>', '<table class="tableEditor" style="width: 100%;">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class="tablehead" colspan="7">ESTIMATED HOURS OF RECORDING</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>Bit Depth</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>Sampling Frequency (kHz)</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>160GB</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>320GB</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>500GB</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>750GB</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div><strong>1TB</strong></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>16</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>44.1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>546 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1092 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1707 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>2560 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>3413 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>16</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>48</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>496 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>993 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1552 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>2327 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>3103 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>24</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>44.1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>359 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>719 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1123 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1684 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>2246 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>24</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>96</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>165 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>331 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>517 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>776 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>1034 hrs</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>', '<table class="tableEditor" style="width: 100%;">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class="tablehead" colspan="2">SYSTEM HARD DRIVE</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>I need:</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Things to look for:</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>High performance operating system drive</td>\r\n<td>Seagate 7200RPM SATA 3GB/s Drives</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Faster boot and program startup times</td>\r\n<td>10,000RPM Drives / RAID 0 array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Data redundancy - live backup mirroring</td>\r\n<td>RAID 1 array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class="tablehead" colspan="2">PROJECT HARD DRIVE(s)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Purpose:</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Things to look for:</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Live recording of 64 Tracks @ 44/48KHz<br /></td>\r\n<td>7200 RPM Drive</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Live recording of 40 Tracks @ 96KHz</td>\r\n<td>7200 RPM Drive</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Live recording of more than 64 Tracks @ 44/48KHz</td>\r\n<td>10,000 RPM drive or RAID 0 Array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Live recording of more than 40 Tracks @ 96KHz</td>\r\n<td>10,000 RPM drive or RAID 0 Array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Large GigaStudio, EWQL, sampling projects</td>\r\n<td>10,000 RPM sample drive or RAID 0 Array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Data redundancy - Live backup mirroring</td>\r\n<td>RAID 1 Array</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>', 'What is Raid', '<p>A RAID Array uses technology that allows two (identical model) hard drives to look like one to the computer. The operating system will assign one drive letter to the drives yet spread the data across both/multiple drives - either doubling the throughput of the drive or providing a "mirrored" drive (or perpetual backup) in the case of hard drive failure.

Another backup strategy is recommended.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>RAID 1 Specs:</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> RAID 1 provides fault tolerance as all writes are duplicated on both drives. </li>\r\n<li>100% redundancy of data means no rebuild is necessary in case of a disk failure, just a copy to the replacement disk.</li>\r\n<li>Transfer rate per block is equal to that of a single disk.</li>\r\n<li>Since both drives have the same data on it you lose the capacity of one of the drives - inefficient but safe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>What do we think of RAID 0?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The latest generation SATA 3 GB drives are very fast, we''ve tested <strong>single drive setups</strong> that can easily handle <strong>&plusmn;64 tracks (live) @ 44/48KHz</strong> or <strong>&plusmn;40 tracks @ 96KHz</strong>. Only if you''ll be working on projects larger than this will the extra performance of RAID 0 become important. If you think you would indeed benefit from having faster drives or drive arrays, we strongly suggest you consider the <strong>Western Digital 10,000 RPM</strong> drives - you will see similar performance out of one 10,000 RPM drive as you would out of RAID 0 array without doubling the risk of data loss.<br /> <br /> We''ve had many people come to us explaining they need RAID 0 because they work on very large sample based projects. Again, we''ve done very thorough testing in applications such as <strong>GigaStudio, EWQL</strong> and we''ve actually found that spreading out samples across multiple drives actually gives better performance and yields higher track counts than a RAID 0 setup. So here again RAID 0 just isn''t right.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Clincher</strong>: With RAID 0 you double the chance of losing all your data. If one drive fails all data on both disks is lost. Depending on two drives for one set of data means the chance of one of those drives failing doubles.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What do we think of RAID 1?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>We love RAID 1 as we ourselves have been victims of drives dying during critical times. Luckily they''ve all been in a RAID 1 setup and we haven''t lost any of the data. In fact when a drive does die, you can simply continue working until you have a replacement. Once you have the replacement, simply install it, boot up the system and the RAID utilities will repopulate the data so that you once again have fully redundant backups of everything. It''s really that easy. Although we still recommend having an additional backup strategy (external drives, DVD-Rs) when utilizing RAID 1 you are taking a very big step towards having failsafe data storage. The only real downside is  that you pay for twice the amount of storage - do we think it''s worth it? Absolutely!</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0.00, '1276152947.png', 4, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Virtually all Windows DAW software will work well on the 32-bit version of XP. The main difference between <strong> XP</strong> <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>XP Professional</strong>, for DAW purposes, is that with Pro you have the ability to use <strong>Remote Desktop</strong> to terminal into your DAW - this can be useful if you plan on controlling your DAW from a secondary computer/laptop also running Windows XP - for example you want to control your DAW from a vocal booth. On <strong>Windows XP Home</strong> one can control the computer remotely using a 3rd party open source/free software called <strong>Ultra VNC</strong>. With Windows XP Professional you can also join your computer to a domain, along with many other more advanced networking features generally best left turned off on a Digital Audio Workstation. For the ultimate in lean speed and reliability <strong>we recommend Windows XP Home. </strong></p>\r\n<h2>Windows 7 Professional 32-Bit:</h2>\r\n<p>Reyniers Audio participated in Microsoft''s Beta Testing program for Windows 7.&nbsp; We''ve been running Beta versions of the operating system since the first release was made available to us from Microsoft.&nbsp; We are glad to report that it will be a worthy replacement of Windows XP.&nbsp; Windows 7''s performance is on par (if not slightly faster) with what we''ve come to expect from Windows XP.&nbsp; We still offer Windows XP Home as the default operating system as it is on its 3rd Service Pack meaning it is the most compatible operating system on the market.&nbsp; Although Windows 7 is miles ahead of Vista in regards to compatibility there are still some legacy interfaces that simply will not work with.&nbsp; Check with your Audio Interface manufacturers for status of Windows 7 compatibility.</p>\r\n<h2>Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit:</h2>\r\n<p>There are good reasons to purchase Windows 7 Pro 64 and there are good  reasons not to.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>The Good:</strong> In order for your OS to utilize more than 4GB of RAM it needs a 64-bit Operating System. This is due to the fact that in Windows 32-bit there isn''t enough address space to be able to see beyond 4 GBs of memory (4GB installed on Windows 32-bit will only register as 3-3.5GB). With Windows 7 64 you are able to access all the memory your motherboard supports. More so, having a 64-bit operating system will give a remarkable performance increase in software that supports the 64-bit architecture.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Bad:</strong> Windows 64-bit is not very mature yet and it will most likely cause problems with software and hardware that isn''t fully compatible with it. This is especially true in the audio recording world, where many audio interfaces don''t even have 64-bit drivers. Before choosing Windows 7 64-bit we strongly suggest calling us to discuss your likelihood of success. Keep in mind that often times a 64-bit driver is available for "x" hardware/software but it is still very buggy, problematic and not recommended. In other words, getting a 64-bit OS running as smoothly as it''s much more mature counterpart - the 32-bit OS, can be a challenge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Windows Vista:</h2>\r\n<p>We strongly suggest staying away from Windows Vista, it is far from being usable as a DAW Operating System.</p>', '<table class="tableEditor" style="width: 100%;">\r\n<thead> \r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Purpose:</strong></td>\r\n<td>Recommended Choices:</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead> \r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>General PRO DAW use</td>\r\n<td>Windows XP Home 32-Bit, Windows 7 Pro 32-Bit<br /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>DAW on Domain Network</td>\r\n<td>Windows XP Professional 32-Bit, Windows 7 Professional<br /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Require more than 4GB RAM for big projects using HyperSampled Virtual Instruments</td>\r\n<td>Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0.00, '1276153144.png', 13, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
