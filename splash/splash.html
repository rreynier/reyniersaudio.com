                    <p>A digital audio workstation (DAW) is a computer-based system that is used
                        to record, edit and play back digital audio tracks.  There are three
                        components that make up a DAW: the daw computer, the daw software and the audio interface.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="wiadc">What is a DAW Computer?</h2>
                    <p>A DAW computer is a specifically designed for digital audio
                        production. These computers are highly optimized for effects
                        processing in real-time. A good DAW computer is reliable, quiet and very fast.  
                        A good DAW computer must also be ready to record out of the box; fully tweaked and stripped of unecessary software or services.

                    <p>Sometimes reffered to as a DAW host, DAW software communicates with the audio interface
                        and the computer to record one or many audio signals.
                        The DAW software provides the user interface that enables recording, editing
                        and playback of audio projects.<img alt="Pro Tools DAW Host Software" src="/splash/images/dawsoftware.jpg"/></p>
                    <p>
                        DAW software usually have extensive MIDI recording, editing,
                        and playback capabilities, and some even have video editing features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some examples of DAW hosts are Pro Tools, Cubase, Nuendo, Reaper, Ableton Live, Wavelab,
                        StudioLive, etc...

                    <h2 class="wiaai">What is an Audio Interface?</h2>
                    <p>An Audio Interface (aka sound card) is the hardware that converts analog audio
                        signals, such as those from your microphones, or guitars, into digital data (AD Conversion). <br />This information is recorded via your DAW Software to the hard-drives on your DAW Computer.
                        <img alt="Digital Audio Interface" src="/splash/images/audiointerface.jpg"/>
                        Some audio
                        intefaces come with microphone preamps, others require an outboard preamp. The audio interface is also what provides the analog audio signal for your studio monitors or headphones (DA Conversion).

                    <h2 class="wmadcbfarttap">What makes a DAW Computer better for audio recording than the average PC?</h2>
                    <p>Recording, editing and mixing music requires the computer to make calculations at a rate
                        that most day to day computing tasks do not require. This is especially true for in-the-box, low latency recording and mixing.
                   </p>
                    <p>Even high-end gaming systems will often introduce enough latency to hinder
                        a musician from recording a proper performance. This is due to the fact that most computer manufacturers use components of inferior quality that cause severe latency spikes, resulting in glitchy recording or playback. DAW Computers on the other hand, are
                        specifically engineered for doing these highly time-sensitive computations without hiccups, and for extended periods of time.</p>
                    <p>Since DAW Computers are intended for the studio they are usually
                        assembled with silence in mind. Another thing that many computer manufacturers consider un-important.
